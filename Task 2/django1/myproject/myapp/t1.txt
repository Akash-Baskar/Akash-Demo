Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting
various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.
As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. 
For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's 
and birds behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions.
Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.
While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successful photography of some types of 
wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, long focal length lenses for 
birds and underwater cameras for marine life.
